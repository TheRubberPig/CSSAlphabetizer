# CSSAlphabetizer
A lightweight python script to read in a CSS file and reorder the elements in alphabetical order. It keeps the original CSS and creates a new one with -sorted appended to the file name. 

Currently the python script has to be ran in the same location as the desired css file for the script to work.

The script also can't perfom any extra sorting right now, i.e: descending or sorting class element differently to tag elements.

How to run:

- Drop the python script into the directory where the CSS file is located
- Open a command window
- Run the command cssSorter.py -i (inputfile name) -o (outputfile name)
- Check the directory for your new Alphabetised CSS file!
