# CSSAlphabetizer
A simple python script to read in a CSS file and reorder the elements in alphabetical order. It keeps the original CSS and creates a new one with -sorted appended to the file name. 

Currently the python script has to be ran in the same location as the desired css file for the script to work.

The script also can't perfom any extra sorting right now, i.e: descending or sorting class element differently to tag elements. the next release will work on being able to set conditions for the script to follow
